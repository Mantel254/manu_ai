#  Manu.ai — The Most Chill Kenyan Chatbot 🇰🇪
- manu.ai is a lightweight Kenyan AI chatbot that speaks Swahili (kinda 😅), cracks jokes, and drops streetwise responses — powered by Groq + LLaMA 3 + Flask. No GPUs were harmed. Just vibes and a few hours of code.

# 🛠️ How It Works
This isn’t some deep-learning, supercomputer-backed system. It’s a simple setup:

- You send a message via a chat form.

- Backend (Flask) sends it to Groq API (LLaMA 3).

- Groq replies.

- Reply shows up in chat UI (styled with TailwindCSS).

- you have an AI chatbot!

# 🧠 Features
- Speaks Swahili + informal English

- Built on Groq's blazing-fast LLaMA 3

- Stylish, mobile-first UI (Tailwind CSS)

- Fast & light — deployable anywhere

- Doesn't hallucinate much (hopefully)
